# Asynchronous Programming

> "Synchronous basically means that you can only execute one thing at a time. Asynchronous means that you can execute multiple things at a time and you don't have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to next one."

"The Internet", "The Web", "Web Apps". All of these terms describe something that is interconnected. If you zoom out a bit, the entire internet is basically billions of computers all sharing information and software! But so far your projects have been all alone on your computer :(

Everything you have learned so far happens on the _callstack_, everything on the callstack executes _synchronously_. Synchronous means that each line of code will finish executing before the next one starts. Think of infinite loops, your browser freezes because nothing else can happen while the loop is looping!

What makes web development so cool is the ... web. Being able to build applications that connect computers form across the internet. This also introduces some challenges, it can take some time for computers to talk to each other across the internet. You don't want your apps freezing while you wait to hear back from another computer.

Enter _asynchronous programming_: writing code that tells your browser to start one task and move on to a new task while you wait for the first to finish. This is possible because of the _Event Loop_.

## Learning Objectives

- Browser
  - Using `setTimeout` and `setInterval` to schedule tasks on the _Event Loop_
  - Using `Promise` to write more manageable asynchronous code
  - Refactoring promises to `async`/`await`
  - Using `fetch` to get and consume data from APIs

[TOP](#asynchronous-programming)

## About the Projects

Projects in this module will build on what you learned in the last module by adding in _network calls_ to APIS and scheduled tasks on the event loop.

## Week 1

The Event Loop!

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Before Class

- [./the-event-loop](./the-event-loop)
  - watch a couple of the videos
  - step through the timeout examples in [jsv9000.app](https://www.jsv9000.app/)
- [./isolate](./isolate)
  - `labeled-logger`
  - `event-loop` examples

### During Class

#### Before Break

- _All Together_:
  - [The Event Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI7sN1dDwcY) - restaurant analogy
  - [./the-event-loop](./the-event-loop): timeouts examples
- _In Small Groups_:
  - [./isolate](./isolate): timeout exercises & sync vs. async

#### After break

- _All Together_:
  - Callback Hell at the Restaurant
  - [./the-event-loop](./the-event-loop): promises
- _In Small Groups_:
  - [./isolate](./isolate): promises

### After Class

> individual project

Try to reverse-engineer [stopwatch.net](https://stopwatch.net/) 3 times:

1. using `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout` and `clearInterval`
2. using Promises
3. using `async` and `await`

There is not starter repository and you do not need to write a full Single Page App, one JS script for each version is ok. You should focus on the event loop and the user experience.

```markdown
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_)
  - with one page for each version
  - each version can be identical for the user, but have different code
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] wireframe
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
```

Studying the [/promistaurant](./promistaurant), this will help you understand to solve asynchronous problems by thinking about what needs to be done in a specific order and what can be done at the same time.

  - [js.info](https://javascript.info/async): 1 -> 4
  - Isolate: 3. Promises
  - [Callbacks, Promises, Async](#callbacks-promises-async)
- APIs & REST
  - [Restful Routes?](https://medium.com/@atingenkay/restful-routes-what-are-they-8fe221521bb)

  - `returning-promises` & `async-await`: examples

### During Class

#### Before Break

- What is `async`/`await`? Cover some examples together.
- APIs - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
  - put this URL into the browser URL bar, what happens?
  - now try `fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1")` in your console, what do you see?
  - how can you get the data from the response?
- API Call functions
  - examples

#### After Break

- API Call functions
  - exercises

### After Class

> individual project

You've made it this far, time to show off a bit! Build yourself a new home page + portfolio to show off what you've built. You will use the GitHub API to fetch data about your profile, your projects, your contributions, whatever you're most proud of. (hint: avoid pushing your GitHub auth token!). Here's some links to get you started:

- [Starter Repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/starter-github-api-home-page)
- [The Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) - GitHub API documentation
- [HamScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJspH620ZsU) (good intro)
- [Johnny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd8dU-XpsRI) (intro to fetch)
- [Dev By RayRay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgqZf4Qtas) (build a component)
- [Hussein Nasser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlE6o-iYcE) (long intro with DOM)
- [Coding Shiksha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7mR7BEzx0s) (quick demo)

And a checklist:

```markdown
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] wireframe
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```

## Week 3

Project week, no new material!

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Before Class

Take it easy, focus on your portfolio

### During Class

- Questions and answers + code review
- All together then in small groups

### After Class

Keep working on your home page. No worries if you don't finish it this week! It's always a work in progress, and you'll have much more to add after next module.
